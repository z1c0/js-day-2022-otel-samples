# OpenTelemetry JavaScript Samples

These are the samples as used and demoed in my [OpenTelemetry JS to the rescue!](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/event/javascript-day-0518)
talk.

The demos show several stages (`01-server...` - `04-server...`) of "instrumenting" a simple
Node.js application with OpenTelemetry.
The folder `client-server` shows the step-wise approach of how to create an actual
distributed trace for a client and a server application.

The API version of [opentelemetry-js](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) used in those samples is `1.0.2`.
